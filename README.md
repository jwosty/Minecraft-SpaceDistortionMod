The main concept of this Minecraft mod is to indroduce 2 main things that will enhance you MC experience, both of which bend and twist the
Minecraft space. What does this mean? Well, the first (and my personal favorite) is the addition of the [Stargate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki
/Stargate), interplanetary portals that can "dial" to each other and establish a short-lived, wormhole. The second would enable youto build
structures that are bigger on the inside, inspired by the [TARDIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS).

###More about this mod's Stargate
- Each Stargate will have an "address" made up of 7 symbols based on the its coordinates
- Stargates will be one-way
- Will be able to stay open for a max of 512 seconds, or 8.53Ì… minutes (as opposed to the 38 minutes in the TV series)
- Ancient ruins will possibly be implemented with 1 stargate, lots of loot, and a chance of a cartouche with many other valid gate addresses
etched onto it

###Building and running
As with most Minecraft mods, this project is built on the Minecraft Forge modding API. The latest version uses Gradle, which is included in
this repository. To build, execute `gradlew setupDevWorkspace && gradlew build` where `gradlew` is `./gradlew` on *nix and `gradlew.bat` on
Windows. The resulting jar will appear in build/libs.
