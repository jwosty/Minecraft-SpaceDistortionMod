The "Space Distortion Mod" is a Minecraft mod destined be pretty awesome if I finish it.

#...Why?
The main concept is to indroduce 2 main things that will enhance you MC experience, both having to do with, well, distorting space. What does this
mean? Well, the first (and my personal favorite) is the addition of the [Stargate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starga
te), interplanetary portals that can "dial" to each other and establish a short-lived, wormhole. The second would enable you to build structures
that are bigger on the inside, inspired by the [TARDIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS).

#More about this mod's Stargate
- Each Stargate will have an "address" made up of 7 symbols based on the its coordinates
- Stargates will be one-way
- Will be able to stay open for a max of 512 seconds, or 8.53Ì… minutes (as opposed to the 38 minutes in the TV series)
- Ancient ruins will possibly be implemented with 1 stargate, lots of loot, and a chance of a cartouche with many other valid gate addresses
